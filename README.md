# TDC-Time-to-Digital-Converter
A **Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC)** is an electronic circuit or device used to measure time intervals with very high precision, typically on the order of picoseconds or nanoseconds. It is widely used in applications where precise timing is critical, such as in physics experiments, time-of-flight measurements, and digital communication systems.

### Key Concepts of a TDC:

1. **Principle of Operation:**
   A TDC measures the time between two events by converting the time interval into a digital value. This is done by measuring the delay between a "start" and a "stop" signal and then producing a corresponding digital output.

2. **Resolution:**
   The resolution of a TDC is the smallest time difference it can measure. This is a key performance metric, typically ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds. The resolution depends on the design and the technology used, such as the clock speed or the delay elements in the circuit.

3. **Basic Architecture:**
   - **Counter-based TDCs:** These use a high-frequency clock to count the number of clock cycles between the start and stop signals. The resolution of the TDC in this case is limited by the clock period (1/clock frequency).
   - **Delay-line TDCs:** These use a chain of delay elements (gates) that introduce a known and precise delay between signals. When the start signal propagates through the delay chain, the stop signal captures which stage it has reached. The number of stages reached provides a fine-grained time measurement.

4. **Types of TDCs:**
   - **Direct TDC:** Measures time by counting clock cycles between the start and stop signals. This type may not offer very fine resolution but is simpler in design.
   - **Interpolating TDC:** Combines coarse and fine measurement stages. It uses both a coarse clock cycle counter and a fine measurement mechanism (such as a delay line) to achieve high resolution.

5. **Applications:**
   - **Time-of-flight (ToF) systems:** These systems measure the time it takes for light or sound to travel between two points. TDCs are often used in LiDAR, sonar, and particle physics detectors for precise time measurement.
   - **Digital phase-locked loops (PLLs):** TDCs help measure phase differences between signals in digital PLLs.
   - **High-energy physics experiments:** TDCs are used in particle accelerators to measure the time intervals between particle collisions and detector events.

### TDC in Embedded Systems:
In embedded systems, TDCs are often used for high-precision timing measurements, especially in systems that require fast and accurate data acquisition, such as in radar, communication, or medical imaging systems.
